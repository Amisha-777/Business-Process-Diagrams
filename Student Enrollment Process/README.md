# Student Enrollment Process in University

## ðŸ“ŒProject Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram for the student enrollment process at the University of Nanaimo. The model illustrates the complex interactions between various departments and the applicant, providing a clear visualization of the entire enrollment journey.

## Process Model Key Elements
-   Start and end events
-   Activities performed by students and university departments
-   Decision points and gateways
-   Parallel processes
-   Loops for document updates and payment resolution

## ðŸ”¥Process Highlights
1.  **Application Initiation**: Students fill out the application form and gather all required documents. #ApplicationInitiation
2.  **Application Submission**: Completed applications are submitted either online or in person. #ApplicationSubmission
3.  **Document Review and Validation**:
    -   The Academic Review Committee assesses the application for academic standards and adherence to university policies. #AcademicReview
    -   The application is checked for validity; invalid applications are returned for corrections. #ApplicationValidation
    -   Applicants are notified to update their applications if minor adjustments are needed. #ApplicationAdjustment
4.  **Approval Process**:
    -   Validated applications are forwarded to the Registrar's Office and the Financial Aid Office. #ApprovalProcess
    -   Financial aid applications and tuition payments are processed, with discrepancies addressed through student inquiries. #FinancialAid
5.  **Acceptance Letter Generation**:
    -   Upon successful review and approval, an acceptance letter is generated, emailed to the student, and copies are sent to the Registrar's            and Financial Aid Offices. #AcceptanceLetter
6.  **Enrollment Confirmation**:
    -   After receiving the acceptance letter, the student must confirm their enrollment by submitting payment to the Financial Aid Office.
    -   The system checks for any issues with the enrollment details. If discrepancies arise, they are corrected, and the Admissions Department           is notified. #EnrollmentConfirmation
    -   The system verifies enrollment details; discrepancies are corrected, and the Admissions Department is notified. #EnrollmentVerification
